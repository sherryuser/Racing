# Interactive Racing Game with Arduino Nano and Addressable LED Strip

## Overview

This project is an interactive racing game prototype developed using an Arduino Nano, an addressable LED strip (WS2812), buttons, and a buzzer. The game is designed to provide an engaging and educational tool for learning about IoT concepts. Players control their cars using buttons, and the game features random turn zones where acceleration is restricted. The project demonstrates the integration of various sensors and actuators in an IoT system.

## Features

- Supports multiple players
- Button control for acceleration and deceleration
- Randomly generated turn zones where acceleration is restricted
- Visual feedback using an addressable LED strip
- Audio feedback using a buzzer when a player wins the game

## Components

- Arduino Nano
- Addressable LED Strip (WS2812)
- Push Buttons
- Buzzer
- 5V Power Adapter
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires

## Circuit Diagram

A detailed circuit diagram is provided in the `circuit_diagram.png` file. The connections are as follows:

- **LED Strip**: Data pin to D2 on Arduino Nano
- **Buttons**: Connected to GND and digital pins (e.g., D3, D4)
- **Buzzer**: Connected to D6
- **Power Supply**: 5V adapter powering the Arduino Nano and LED strip

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/racing-game-arduino.git
   cd racing-game-arduino
   ```

2. **Install Arduino IDE**:
   Download and install the Arduino IDE from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

3. **Install FastLED Library**:
   Open the Arduino IDE, go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**. Search for `FastLED` and install it.

4. **Open the project**:
   Open the `racing_game.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.

5. **Upload the code**:
   Connect your Arduino Nano to your computer and upload the code.

## Usage

1. **Power the Arduino**:
   Connect the 5V adapter to power the Arduino Nano and LED strip.

2. **Play the game**:
   - Players control their cars by pressing the buttons.
   - The LED strip shows the positions of the cars and the turn zones.
   - The game ends when a player reaches the winning score, and the buzzer will sound to indicate the winner.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate network connectivity using an ESP8266 module for remote monitoring and control.
- Develop a mobile or web application for enhanced user interface and game control.
- Add more game mechanics, such as obstacles and power-ups, to make the game more dynamic.
- Improve power management to support more LEDs and additional components.
